# Evergreen notes for notion

## Overview

> âš  This extension was written before Notion released their API, by basically reverse engineering the api and types.

The data types and systems were approximation and this hasn't been updated after their api release. Fortunately everything still works.

The extension creates a side panel. Checkout the [website](https://shravansunder.notion.site/Evergreen-Notes-For-Notion-e35e6ed4dd5a45b19bf2de2bb86b1a7e) for pictures and details!

## Some architecture

-  uses webpack with esbuild plugin
-  written in react and redux toolkit
-  notion types in typescript

## what i would do differently

-  use recoil or swr/rtk with state
-  use notion api authentication
-  change the mechanism to get the current page in state
-  cache updates so its not so slow,
   -  maybe use `indexdb` with `dexiejs`
   -  `sql lite` with `absurd-sql` https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql
-  maybe use an existing notion rendering engine, there's a lot of options now

## Thoughts about Notion

Notion is super slow, in search and fetch

-  i would find a better way to cache results
-  faster better way to check for updates to dom and mutation

I find their lack of classification of data types a bizzare decisions. Personally, i would have extracted `Page` as its own type just like `collection`, `block`, `table`. I think this would make things a lot faster in the backend and easeir in front end without sacrificing flexibility. This concrete page model would lend itself to a org wide tasks model in the future as well.

I don't think everything needs to be dynamic and maximally flexible. Opininiated types are useful at times.
